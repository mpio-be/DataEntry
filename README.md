DataEntry: Data Entry interfaces.
------------


The data entry backend is a `MariaDB` database so more people can enter data simultaneously. 
The frontends are UI-s (one per table) based on [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) and [rhandsontable](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rhandsontable).

Individual checks are done by `validators`.
A collection of  `validators` makes an `inspector`.  Data is checked *before* it is saved to the DB by the  `inspector`. 
Each time the `inspector` runs, the *exact* position of the offending cell(s) and the reasons for errors are returned.

The user can bypass the data validation. However the entries saved without validation are flagged in the database and the user is encouraged to explain why the validation was ignored.

Given that `test` DB exists (see `system.file('UI', '.testdb.R', package = 'DataEntry')`)
this UI can be run with: 

``` R
ui = system.file('UI', 'newData', package = 'DataEntry')
shiny::runApp(ui, launch.browser = TRUE)
```


Installation
------------
``` R

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mpio-be/DataEntry")

```
